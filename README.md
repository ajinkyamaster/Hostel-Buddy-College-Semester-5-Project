**Hostel Buddy** turns a paper complaint register into a secure, searchable and intelligent workflow. Students can raise and track maintenance issues, hostel managers can act on their own queues, and the super admin can monitor the complete institution from one dashboard.

</div>

> Built as a **model working version** — realistic end-to-end functionality on a clean layered architecture, without the scope of a full production system.

> **Development status:** The three novelty upgrades are implemented, integration-tested and available on the `main` branch.

**What makes it more than a CRUD app:**

- A **three-role ISA model** — `USER` specialised into `STUDENT`, `MANAGER` and `SUPER_ADMIN`, with the subtype's primary key doubling as its foreign key.
- **Hostel scoping as a real authorization boundary.** A manager cannot read, search or modify another hostel's complaint, and the scope is resolved from the caller's own database row — never from the request. It has its own tests, in both directions.
- **Attachments verified by their bytes**, not their declared type — including a video allowlist narrow enough that anything stored is guaranteed playable.
- An **explainable smart-priority and SLA engine** that scores every complaint, assigns a 2–72 hour target, and tracks on-time or overdue handling.
- **Complaint hotspot analytics** that ranks recurring room-level clusters by volume, open work, Critical cases and overdue SLAs, with period trends and recommended action.
- **Explainable duplicate detection** that warns students before submission and links likely repeats for staff review without exposing another student's description or identity.
- **314 API integration checks**, including a regression suite that pins down every bug found in the code audit.

## 🌟 Feature highlights

| 🎓 Student experience | 🛠️ Staff operations | 🧠 Intelligent layer |
|---|---|---|
| Raise and track complaints | Hostel-scoped work queues | Explainable priority scoring |
| Add verified images and videos | Search, filter and paginate | Automatic SLA deadlines |

## 💡 Novelty upgrades

The latest upgrades move Hostel Buddy beyond basic complaint CRUD and turn historical complaint data into decisions staff can act on.

| Upgrade | What it solves | How Hostel Buddy handles it | Status |
|---|---|---|:---:|
| **⚡ Smart Priority & SLA Engine** | Important complaints can be lost in a first-come-first-served queue | Calculates an explainable urgency score, assigns `Critical`/`High`/`Medium`/`Low` priority, creates a 2–72 hour SLA and tracks whether resolution was met or missed | ✅ Live |
| **📍 Complaint Hotspot Analytics** | Repeated failures in the same room or area are hard to notice | Ranks hostel-room clusters across 7, 30 or 90 days using volume, open work, Critical cases and overdue SLAs, then recommends the next action | ✅ Live |
| **🔎 Duplicate Detection** | Multiple reports of the same active issue create noisy queues | Performs a privacy-safe preflight comparison, explains the match score and links confirmed repeats while still allowing separate incidents | ✅ Live |

### A connected decision flow

```text
Student submits a complaint
            │
            ├──► Duplicate check ──► Warn and link likely repeats
            │
            ├──► Priority engine ──► Score urgency and assign an SLA
            │
            └──► Hotspot engine ──► Detect recurring room-level risk
                                      │
                                      ▼
                         Manager / super-admin action
```

Every result remains explainable: users see why a priority was assigned, staff see what makes a location risky, and duplicate warnings include a transparent similarity score.

## ✨ What each role can do

**Student**
- Register with a roll number and the hostel they live in, then log in and manage a profile
- Raise a complaint — pick a category, describe the issue, optionally attach **a photo and a video**
- Track status in real time: **Pending → In Progress → Resolved → Closed**
- Read the manager's remarks and the resolution date
- Edit or delete a complaint while it is still Pending — and only then
- Personal dashboard with their own complaint statistics

**Hostel manager**
- The complaint queue for **their own hostel** — searching, filtering and paginating it, with the students list and every dashboard figure narrowed the same way
- Advance a complaint's status and leave remarks for the student
- Provisioned by a super admin; there is no public sign-up for this role

**Super admin**
- The same views, **unscoped** — every complaint in every hostel, plus a per-hostel breakdown
- Create, rename and remove hostels
- Create manager accounts and bind each to a hostel

## Deploy on Vercel

For a persistent Vercel deployment, create a Turso libSQL database and set the Vercel environment variables before deploying. See the [Vercel deployment guide](docs/vercel-deployment.md) for the exact steps, login troubleshooting, and the current attachment limitation. The demo credentials below apply only to local development after seeding.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

> Prerequisites: **Node.js 24.x** (for the built-in `node:sqlite` module). No compiler or build tools needed.

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` — at minimum `JWT_SECRET` and the admin credentials.

```bash
npm run seed
```

Seeds a ready-made demo: **3 hostels**, a super admin, **3 managers**, **6 students** and **13 complaints** spread across the whole lifecycle. Safe to re-run — existing rows are left alone.

```bash
npm start
```

The app is then at **http://localhost:4000**. The super admin account is created from `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` on first boot, so it exists even without seeding. Students self-register; managers are created by the super admin.

For development with auto-restart:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Demo logins (after `npm run seed`)

| Role | Email | Password |
|------|-------|----------|
| Super admin | `admin@hostel.test` | `admin123` |
| Manager — Aryabhatta | `manager.aryabhatta@hostel.test` | `manager123` |
| Manager — Ramanujan | `manager.ramanujan@hostel.test` | `manager123` |
| Manager — Bhaskara | `manager.bhaskara@hostel.test` | `manager123` |
| Student | `rahul@hostel.test` — also `ananya`, `karan`, `priya`, `amit`, `sneha` | `student123` |

> Sign in as a manager and then as the super admin to see hostel scoping at work: the same page, the same code, a different slice of the data.

---

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
npm test
```

One command. It starts the server on its own port against a throwaway database and upload directory, seeds the hostels and accounts the scoping tests need, runs all six suites, then shuts down and deletes both. **Your development data is never touched.**

| Suite | Checks | Covers |
|-------|-------:|--------|
| `auth` | 47 | Registration across three roles, login, JWT guards, profile |
| `hostels` | 46 | Public hostel list, super-admin CRUD, manager provisioning |
| `complaints` | 66 | Full student lifecycle, ownership, Pending-only edits, attachments and duplicate detection |
| `admin` | 58 | Staff queue, search, filters, pagination, status transitions, **hostel scoping** |
| `dashboard` | 48 | Student and staff statistics, scoped aggregations, activity trends and complaint hotspots |
| `regression` | 49 | Every bug found in the code audit, plus priority/SLA policy guarantees |
| **Total** | **314** | |

To run one suite against a server you started yourself:

```bash
npm start
```

```bash
npm run test:admin
```

(also `test:auth`, `test:hostels`, `test:complaints`, `test:dashboard`, `test:regression`)

---

## 🗄️ Data model

Eight tables. `USER` is specialised into three subtypes; the specialisation is **disjoint** (a user is exactly one) and **total** (every user is one of them), with `role` as the discriminator. `COMPLAINT_TRIAGE` is a one-to-one extension that holds server-generated priority and SLA policy, while `COMPLAINT_DUPLICATE_MATCH` stores explainable links between likely repeats.

![ER schema](docs/migration/er-schema-v2.png)

Four decisions worth calling out:

- **Shared primary key.** Each subtype's `user_id` is both its PK and its FK to `USER`, so one person cannot hold two identities.
- **`COMPLAINT.student_id` references `STUDENT`, not `USER`.** The database itself refuses a complaint raised by a manager — the rule does not depend on application code being correct.
- **`COMPLAINT` stores its own `hostel_id` and room snapshot.** They record where the complaint was raised *at that time*. If a student later changes hostel or room, the history and hotspot ranking stay truthful.
- **`SUPER_ADMIN` deliberately has no `hostel_id`.** Being unscoped is the whole point of the role, and the schema says so.

Full rationale in **[docs/migration/PHASE-A-design.md](docs/migration/PHASE-A-design.md)**; the schema itself is [src/db/schema.sql](src/db/schema.sql).

## 🔐 Roles & permissions

| Capability | Student | Manager | Super admin |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Raise / edit / delete own complaint (while Pending) | ✅ | — | — |
| View own complaints | ✅ | — | — |
| View **all** complaints | — | own hostel | ✅ all |
| Search, filter, paginate the queue | — | own hostel | ✅ all |
| Advance status · add remarks | — | own hostel | ✅ all |
| List students | — | own hostel | ✅ all |
| Dashboard statistics | own | own hostel | ✅ all |
| Create / edit / delete hostels | — | — | ✅ |
| Create manager accounts | — | — | ✅ |

**How the boundary is enforced.** Every staff read and write passes through a single `assertWithinScope` check in the complaints service. A manager's hostel is looked up from their own row on each call, so it cannot be widened by anything in the request or the token, and a reassignment takes effect immediately. The filter is applied in SQL, so rows a manager may not see are never loaded in the first place — not fetched and then hidden.

A complaint's hostel is likewise taken from the student's record at creation and never accepted from the client, so nobody can file a complaint against a hostel they do not live in.

---

## 🗺️ Complaint lifecycle

```
Student submits          Staff work it                 Done
    │                        │                          │
 Pending  ──────►  In Progress  ──────►  Resolved  ──────►  Closed
                                         (resolved_at set)
```

The student is read-only on status; staff drive every transition.

The lifecycle is enforced server-side: a complaint only ever moves **forward**. Re-sending the current status is allowed — so remarks can be edited without a state change — but anything that would move it backwards is rejected with `409 INVALID_TRANSITION`. The status dropdown offers only the values the server will accept. This is what guarantees a complaint can never sit at Pending while still carrying a resolution date.

### Smart priority and SLA

Every complaint is scored automatically from its category and specific urgency signals in the description. Students cannot choose or override priority. The result is explainable in both student and staff views, and editing a Pending complaint recalculates it from the original submission time.

| Priority | Target | Typical signal |
|---|---:|---|
| Critical | 2 hours | Fire, smoke, electric shock, exposed wire, flooding |
| High | 8 hours | Security or electrical issue, major service outage |
| Medium | 24 hours | Plumbing, water supply, or operational interruption |
| Low | 72 hours | Routine furniture, cleaning, or general request |

The dashboard reports Critical and overdue totals, staff can filter by priority or SLA state, and resolved complaints are marked as SLA met or missed.

### Complaint hotspot analytics

The staff dashboard detects recurring clusters at the **hostel + registered room** level over selectable 7, 30 or 90-day windows. Each location receives a transparent risk score based on complaint volume, unresolved work, Critical priority and overdue SLAs. It also shows the dominant complaint category, compares the current window with the previous equal window, and recommends the next operational action.

Hotspots obey the same authorization boundary as the complaint queue: a manager receives locations from their assigned hostel only, while the super admin receives an institution-wide ranking. The student's registered room is snapshotted when the complaint is raised, so later profile changes cannot rewrite hotspot history; blank rooms are grouped as `Unspecified`.

### Duplicate detection

Before submission, the server compares a complaint with active complaints raised in the same hostel during the previous 30 days. The transparent score combines meaningful text overlap with category and room context; a contextual match cannot compensate for unrelated descriptions. Students receive a privacy-safe warning containing only complaint ID, category, status and match score, and can still submit a genuinely separate incident.

Creation performs the check again and persists up to three strongest links, preventing a race between the warning and submission. Staff see those links in the complaint queue and detail view. Editing a Pending complaint recalculates the links so stale matches are removed automatically.

---

## 📎 Attachments

A complaint may carry **one image and one video**.

| | Image | Video |
|---|---|---|
| Accepted | PNG · JPEG · WEBP | MP4 · WebM |
| Limit | 5 MB | 30 MB |

Both are identified by their **leading bytes**, not the MIME type the browser declares — a text file labelled `image/png` never reaches the uploads directory. The video check is deliberately narrow: MP4 is accepted through its `ftyp` box plus an allowlist of major brands (so QuickTime, which shares the container but will not play in a browser, is rejected), and WebM needs the EBML marker *and* the `webm` DocType (so a Matroska file renamed `.webm` is rejected too). Storing a file the complaint page cannot play is worse than refusing it.

There is no maximum duration — that would mean decoding container metadata on the server, and a byte ceiling bounds the storage cost just as well. Replacing or removing an attachment, or deleting the complaint, deletes the file, so the uploads directory never accumulates orphans.

## 🧱 Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | HTML5 · CSS3 · vanilla JS · Chart.js (vendored, no CDN) |
| Backend | Node.js · Express — layered: routes → controllers → services → repositories |
| Database | Node's built-in `node:sqlite` — no native build step; Postgres-compatible schema |
| Auth | JWT + bcrypt password hashing, role-based access control |
| Security | `helmet` headers + CSP, rate-limited auth endpoints, byte-level upload validation |
| Uploads | Multer → local `/uploads` (swappable for object storage) |

Local development uses Node's built-in SQLite, so a teammate can clone and run with **no compiler toolchain**. Vercel uses remote libSQL for durable accounts and complaints; see [the deployment guide](docs/vercel-deployment.md). The local driver choice is explained in [problems_faced_and_bugs_encountered.md](docs/problems_faced_and_bugs_encountered.md) (D5). Trade-offs behind the rest: [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) §9.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Browser (static pages)  ──JSON/JWT──►  Express API  ──SQL──►  SQLite
  presentation tier                    application tier         data tier
                                   routes → middleware →
                                   controllers → services → repositories
```

The frontend holds **no business rules**. Validation, authorization, hostel scoping and the complaint lifecycle all live on the server, so they hold no matter which client calls the API. The repository layer is the only place that touches SQL, so the database can be swapped without touching business logic. Full write-up: **[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)**.
